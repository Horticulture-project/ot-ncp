# OpenThread Co-Processor
#######################

Overview
********

OpenThread Co-Processor allows building a Thread Border Router. The code in this
sample is only the MCU target part of a complete Thread Border Router.
The Co-Processor can act in two variants: Network Co-Processor (NCP) and Radio
Co-Processor (RCP).

Additional required host-side tools (e.g. otbr-agent) to build a Thread Border
Router can be obtained by following.

The preferred Co-Processor configuration of OpenThread is RCP now.
